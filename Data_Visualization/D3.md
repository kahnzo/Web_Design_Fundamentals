# Data Visualization with D3
Examples of D3 code for Graphs and Charts

I would like to use D3 to provide charts and graphs for my websites.  To help, I would like to start with the absolute basics.

Setting up the D3 environment

## D3 Elements
D3 uses Scalable Vector Graphics or SVGs.
### Polyline

[Polyline](https://github.com/kahnzo/D3_Examples/blob/main/polyline/index.html)

### Circle

## Charts
### Example:  Histogram
### Example:  Line Chart

## Importing Data
### Raw Data in HTML
### CSV
### JSON

## Animations
### Example:  Line Chart with Transitions



Example Idea:  Line chart that makes a smooth transition like:

x-axis remains fixed and x-array has to be consistent between the charts
